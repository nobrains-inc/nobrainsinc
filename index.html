<h1 id="i-have-no-brain-and-i-must-h-a-c-c">I have no brain, and I must h a c c</h1>
<p>I've never felt like; so miserable</p>
<p>I've never felt like thinking this will last forever</p>
<p>Baby stay with me</p>
<p>You gotta tell now, your love came all over me</p>
<p>When stars're smile at moon</p>
<p>Wonder how look in your eyes</p>
<p>Just dialing your number</p>
<p>Failing to press the last two</p>
<p>Pray in the heart</p>
<p>When the moon's reaching starts</p>
<p>If you hold me tight</p>
<p>Feeling heart beat so close</p>
<p>Will this last long?</p>
